// CSS Selectors --> the pattern used to select the  elements 
// thumb rule --> if you want any elemnt to be selector and performed action that element should be unique

how are elements defined in DOM
tagname  attribute=value           id ="value"  >text </tagname>
<button type="reset"               id="resetbtn">Reset</button>

// basics selectors 

tagname--> 
for tagname just write the tagname  


class --> 
there are two ways of using of finding selector by class 

[class="container"] -- way 1 

.container --> way2 
 
 for a elment containg multiple classes in a single attribute you should find by 2 ways
 // dirsctly used way 1
[class="nav-searchbar search-big nav-bluebeacon"]

// for finding with . 

steps :-
1 paste value 
2 add dot in the start
3 replace the spaces with dot


id  --> 
to find a id you can use way 1 
[id="resetbtn"]

way2 

used # before the value 
example ==> #resetbtn

attribute and value--> 
to get an elemnt by attribute and value 

simply follow step 

1 select a attribute and value
2 paste it in find bar and add []

general formula --> general formula is a mixture of tagname and attribute value 

tagname[attribute="value"] // this is a general formula 





traveling --> DOM is a resprsentation of html webpage in a boweser --> which 
pranet and child  

travsing --> the method of getting selectors in which you travel form a parent or any parent to require element 
there are 2 way to indicate travlling form parent to child 

1 you can use > sign between 2 elements 
 [class="thumbnail"]>[aria-label="Page navigation example"]>[class="pagination traversal-pagination"]>li

 2 you can use space in between 2 element
[class="thumbnail"] [aria-label="Page navigation example"] [class="pagination traversal-pagination"] li


// you can only travel form  any parent to its  child 


sbiling selectors  ---> when you have  sbiling elemnts with same tag you need to use nth-child() method

syntax ->

:nth-child(number of sbiling)


//thumb rule --> to use nth child the element must be sbiling 

dynamic selectors & partials selectors   --> when the selector are  changing you need to tackle this by geeting selector in 2 ways 

1 use travsing and travel form parent to child tagname 

2 use partical selectors 

-->

// starts with --> ^

example 
[class^="_1sFryS"]

here the sign compares the starting selector only 

// ends with --> $

here the sign compare the ending selector only 

[class$="_2x2Mmc"]




// table--> 

















// learning selectors -->

tagname

class

id

attribute and value
