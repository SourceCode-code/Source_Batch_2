// 1. Write a code to reverse a given array without using reverse function
// Eg. Given array [2, 5, 7, 1]
// Expected output [1, 7, 5, 2]

// 2. Write a code to find out whether the given element is present in the given sorted array or not.
// Eg. Given array [1, 2, 4 , 7, 15, 22, 25] given element 22.
// Expected output:True
// Explanation :
// as 22 is present in a given array print true. 

// In case of given element as 8 output should be false because 8 is not in given array
