1.Software:- Software is a set of instructions that tells a computer or device how to work. 
It comes in two main types:
       System Software: This includes things like operating systems (like Windows or macOS) that help the computer run.
       Application Software: These are programs for specific tasks, like writing documents (Microsoft Word) or browsing the internet (Chrome).

2.Sottware testing:- Software testing is a process to check completeness and correctness of the functionality 
                  with respect to the client requirement.

3.Software Quality assurance:- QA is a set of activities for ensuring Quality in the process,
                               QA is used to follow process & avoiding buds,
                               QA is prevening defects

4.SDLC:- stands for Software Developement Life Cycle
          There are multiple stages in sdlc-
          1.Information/ Requirement collection: Business analyst (BA) collects the requirement from client for developing Software, this document is called as buisness requirement specification(BRS)
          2. Analysis: BA analysis this document and convert BRS to SRS (Software Requirement specification) document, SRS document defines functional requirement to be Developement
          *Content of SRS document- 1.Functional requirement
                                    2. Use cases -> I/P, Process, O/Process
                                    3. Snapshots-snapshots can capture the visual state of an application.
          3. Design: design team prepares design of application, it is called as mockup.Design prepared by design architect or solution engineer
          4. Coding/Developement: Developement team is involved in this stage, there are two type of Developement complete in stage 1.Front-end Developement 2.Back-end Developement
          5. Testing: After complete the developement the application come under testing, we test engineer perform the testing on application. 
          There are three typeof testing perform on application:
                        1.White box testing- TO check completeness and correctness of programs, performed by developer
                        2.Black box testing-To check completeness and correctness of functionality, performed by tester, Here we check positive and negative scenarios
                        3.Gre box testing- Black box tester having knowledge of Coding
           6. Maintainance: After giving application to client, if there is any issue in application, itis fixed under Maintainance             
                
5.SDLC Approaches:-
            1. Waterfall Model: Waterfall is a step by step process, every stages is performed sequentially
             that is one after another
             Information gathering >> Analysis >> Design >> Coding >> Testing.
             The all stsges performed in a specific time that is called Release(generally release are 3 months).
             During the testing, if any defect is found ,it is logged and fixed in next realese.
             Waterfall Model used when, Requirement are very well documented and clear and there is no any change in requirement
             Disadvantage- unable to see any working Software during release & difficult to measure progress within stages

            2. Agile Methodology: Its a approach of SDLC, in which stages are performed simultaneously that mean developement and testing perform at same level, 
            The general flow of the agile is 1.Stakeholder-is top most element in agile,
                                                           he has a set of all requirement.
                                             2. Product owner- Product owner collects the requirement for project from Stakeholder. Those complete requirement for project are called project backlog
                                             3.Sprint Backlog-In Sprint planning meeting requirement are finalized, those requirement are called sprint backlog     
                                             4.User Stories- From sprint backlog scrum master prepare user Stories for that sprint
                                             5.Test cases- From the user stories we test engineer prepares test cases, then execution of test cases 
                                             after the complete the testing we deliver the application to client         
            In agile methodology change in requirement is allowed.

            3. V model: The V-model is a type of sdlc model where process execute in a sequential manner in V-shape. It is also known as verification and validation model.
            In V-model stages followed--Requirement analysis >> System design >> Architect design >> Component design >> Implementation >> Component test >> Integration testing >> Snapshots testing >> Acceptance testing.(all stages are performed sequentially in V-shape).

            4. Fish model- The fish model is also known as static and dynamic testing. In this every stages performed sequentially and all stages under reviewed at the time of developement.
            BRS >> SRS >> Design >> Coding >> Testing.


6.Agile Ceremonies:- In agile methodology we need to follow some meetings that is known as agile
                      Ceremonies. There are different agile Ceremonies
                      1.Sprint planning meeting- In this meeting requirement for sprint are finalized i.e sprint backlog. Requirement for sprint are finalized depending on- Clinet priority, Efforts required, Resources available.
                      Product owner, scrum master, dev team lead, testing team lead participate in this meeting.
                      Duration: 2-3 hours

                      2.Daily Stand-up (Daily Scrum):Purpose: To synchronize the team and address any immediate challenges.
                      Participants: Development Team, testing team, Scrum Master and Product Owner.
                      Activities: Each team member shares what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any blockers they're facing.
                      Duration: 15 min

                      3.Sprint Review Meeting:
                      Purpose: To inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog if necessary.
                      Participants: Development Team, testing team, Scrum Master and Product Owner.
                      Activities: Demonstration of completed work, gathering feedback, and discussing what was accomplished during the sprint.
                      Duration: 1-2 hours

                      4.Sprint Retrospective:
                      Purpose: To reflect on the sprint and identify improvements for future sprints.
                      Participants: Development Team, testing team, Scrum Master and Product Owner.
                      Activities: Discuss what went well, what didnâ€™t, and how the team can improve its processes and collaboration.
                      Duration: 1-2 hours.

7.User Stories:- User story are used to explain the expected behaviour of software, usually from the perspective of a user.
Contents of User story- 1.Summary
                        2.Acceptance Criteria
                        3.Assigne 
                        4.Test engineer
                        5.Story Point

8.Test Cases:- Conditions to be applied, The navigational statement to define functionality.
               Test cases design "means how to test?".
               Contents of Test cases-
               Sr.No | User Story | Module | Test case | Test steps | Test Data | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status.

9.Test scenario:- It is nothing but the functionality, Test scenario means "what to test?".
                  One Test scenario consist of multiple number of test cases.


10.Priority:- Importance of the defect with respect to requirement.
              Urgency of defect with respect to requirement.
              Priority marks developer by discuss with tester.

11.Severity:- Seriousness of defect with respect to functionality.
              Severity marks by Tester.
                                                           Severity       |     Priority
* Examples: 1.User is not able to add item in cart=          High                   High
            2.On UI having any spelling mistake=             Low                    High
            3.Web page not found when user click on link=     High                  Low


12.Smoke Testing:-
Purpose: To verify that the most critical functions of an application work after a new build or deployment.
Scope: Broad and shallow; tests the main features to ensure the application is stable enough for further testing.
When Performed: Conducted after each build or release to catch major issues early.
Outcome: If the smoke test passes, the build is considered stable enough for deeper testing. If it fails, the build is rejected for further development.
Example: Checking that the application launches, users can log in, and key functionalities are operational.


13.Sanity Testing:-
Purpose: To verify that specific functionalities work after changes have been made to the application, particularly after bug fixes or minor changes.
Scope: Narrower and deeper; focuses on specific areas or functionalities to ensure they work correctly.
When Performed: Conducted after receiving a new build that includes bug fixes or specific improvements.
Outcome: If the sanity test passes, the team can proceed with further testing. If it fails, it indicates that the recent changes may have introduced new issues.
Example: After fixing a bug related to user registration, sanity testing would check only that registration functionality to confirm it works as intended. 


14.Functional Testing:- Here we are use to check all functionalities with respect to client requirement. Functional testing is also known as system testing.
In Functional testing we are checking few coverage:
           1.Behaviour coverage- Here we check behaviour of each element:
                                  Element         |     Behaviour
                                  Test box            Focus/ Unfocus
                                  Radio button         ON/OFF
                                  Drop down           List should be displayed
                                  Check box           Check/ Uncheck
                                  Button               Enabled/Disable

           2.Input Domain coverage- Here we check size and datatype of Input
                                    BVA-Boundary Value Analysis
                                    ECP-Equivalence class partition

           3.Backend coverage - Here we check front end information save in database or not and this info
                                reflects on UI or not.
                                Here validate impact of database on frontend operationa.

           4.Error handling coverage- Here we check error message is displayed or not.
                                      This is for checking prevention of negative navigation, Tested for valid and Invalid data.

           5.Calculation based coverage- Here we check arithmatic Calculation.


15.Non-Functional Testing:- After completion of functional testing we go for non functional testing, there are
                            different non functional testing are:
                            1.Recovery Testing-During this testing we check wheather application recovers from abnormal situation to normal situation or not.
                            e.g. Downloading PDF, due to lack of charging laptop is off but when we start the system redirect to the same page.

                            2.Compatability testing-Here we check wheather application works as expected on customer expected platform or not, here we are checking application on different browsers or different divices so its called as browser Compatability testing.
                            e.g:Firefox, chrome, Microsoft edge etc 

                            3.Sanitation Testing-Here we check and find out the extra features which are not part of requirement
                            e.g: At the amount section there is no requirement for currency symbol.

                            4.Responsive Testing-here we check Responsiveness of application at different zoom level 
                            e.g:75%,80%,90%, 100%, 125% etc

                            5.Performance Testing- In Performance testing, we are giving load on application and check its performance.
                            Here load and stress testing are done,
                            Load testing:here we are aplying load within a limit and check its performance
                            Stress Testing:here we are aplying load beyond the limit and check its performance 
                            This testing perform on J-meter tool 

16.Re-testing:-After the fixing defect, we get a modified build for testing .
               To check that the bug is fixed or not on modified build is called re-testing.

17.Regression testing:- Regression testing means testing on modified build to ensure bug fix and to ensure
                        side effects of bug fix.


18.Final Regression testing:- Final regression testing is a type of regression testing conducted at the end of 
                              the software development lifecycle, typically just before a product is released. Its primary purpose is to ensure that the entire application works as intended after all changes, bug fixes, and enhancements have been made. 
                              It usually involves a thorough testing of the entire application, including all critical functionalities, to ensure no new defects have been introduced.
                              The goal is to validate the stability of the software, confirming that both new and existing features operate correctly together.


19.UAT(User Acceptance Testing):-In UAT, testing team, developement team & client is involved.
                                 Here end to end testing perform on application
                                 Focuses on functionality, usability, and overall user experience.
                                 Reduces the risk of issues arising after deployment, leading to smoother implementation and user adoption.

                                 There are two type of UAT:
                                 1.Alpha testing- Alpha testing is performed to identify all possible bugs before releasing product to end user.
                                 Alpha testing is performed by in house team, where both black and white box testing techniques can be used.
                                 Aim of alpha testing is to test the application by considering end user point of view

                                 2.Beta testing-This testing perform by real user/client.
                                 This is also called as external UAT.
                                 Test the software in a real-world environment and gather feedback from actual users.


20.Integration Testing:-Integration testing is a crucial phase in the software testing lifecycle where
                        individual components or systems are combined and tested as a group. The main goal is to identify any issues that arise when these components interact with one another.
                        To verify that integrated components work together as intended.
                        To uncover interface defects, data flow issues, and communication problems between modules.
                        There are some type of Integration testing:
                        1.Big Bang Integration Testing-All components or modules are integrated at once and 
                                                       tested together.
                                                        It is Simple to implement, allows for testing of the entire system in one go.
                                                        But Difficult to isolate defects, as it can be challenging to determine which component is causing an issue.

                        2.Incremental Integration Testing-Components are integrated and tested one at a 
                          time or in small groups. This approach can be further divided into:
                              1.Top-Down Integration Testing- Testing starts from the top-level modules 
                                                              and progressively integrates lower-level modules.
                              2.Bottom-Up Integration Testing-Testing begins with lower-level modules and 
                                                               gradually integrates higher-level modules.


21.Defect Life Cycle:- During the testing if we found any defect, we log that defect in Jira tool, we assigne 
                       the particular developer , in discription we write step to reproduce and attach some screenshots for proof, then its status in new.
                       After that developer open that defect and fix that defect.
                       After that we retest that defect on modified build.
                       Stages of Defect lifecycle is:
                       New >> Open >> Fixed >> Retest >> Close
                       If it is fixed, we close it either we reopen this defect .

22.Adhoc Testing:-During final regression testing, if we have a maximum number of test cases and less time,
                  then we go for Adhoc testing.
                  Here we check random test cases
                  To evaluate the software's usability and overall functionality in a spontaneous manner.

23.Exploratory Testing:-If we dont have any test cases or any other documents for required for testing
                        but we are aware about functional flow of application, then Exploratory testing is Performed
                        The purpose is to discover defects and issues that may not be captured by scripted tests.
                        Especially useful in situations where time is limited, requirements are unclear, or when the application is constantly evolving.
