7 Domains of Wellness
A person’s wellness can be defined as their "state of being in good health, especially as an actively pursued goal.” Wellness is not static, but rather an ongoing collection of choices an individual makes every day. Wellness is often said to have seven dimensions, or domains. These seven domains of wellness encompass the broadest range of human needs. The first step toward wellness is identifying how the seven domains of wellness are interrelated and influence each other.


The seven domains of wellness are: physical, social, occupational, emotional, intellectual, environmental, and spiritual. These domains can be used to assess the state of your own health or the population at large. When one domain is suffering, the others will also be affected. Read on to learn more about each domain.


Physical wellness
Physical wellness is the body's ability to function at its best. This includes:
•	Physical activity and nutrition. People who are physically active, eat a healthy diet, and sleep well tend to be healthier.

•	The body’s ability to heal itself after injury or illness by producing new cells and tissues (recovery).
•	The body’s ability to cope with stress through relaxation techniques, such as meditation or yoga, that can lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety and improve mood (resilience).
Physical wellness also includes good sleep habits—getting enough restorative sleep each night—as poor quality of sleep has been linked to an increased risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes in adults, as well as mental health problems in children.


Social wellness
Social wellness is the ability to make and maintain meaningful relationships. It is important to have a good support network, know your purpose in life, feel a sense of control over your own destiny, and have trust in others.


Social wellness also includes being able to participate in activities that bring you joy. This can be anything from spending time with family or friends, participating in recreational sports, or going on vacations with loved ones. Social wellness gives us the strength we need for all areas of our lives - physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual - because it is through social interactions that we are able to connect with others who provide us comfort and encouragement when times are tough – or just for fun!


Occupational wellness
To be happy and healthy, you must be part of a community. Being part of a community means being connected with people who share your values and interests, as well as living in an environment that provides opportunities for personal growth. In addition to being connected with others, one of the most important aspects of wellness is having a career you enjoy.


There are many things you can do to make sure that your job fulfills all seven domains: physical activity, work-life balance, social activities outside work hours (volunteerism), health insurance and retirement benefits, supportive managers at work who encourage employees’ mental health (counseling services), flexible schedules so people don’t have to choose between being present for family or missing out on important events because they have no paid time off (paid maternity leave), having enough money saved up so that one can live comfortably without worry about paying bills (retirement plans), and time off from work in order to concentrate on other priorities when necessary (sabbaticals).


Emotional wellness
Emotional wellness is the ability to effectively manage our feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. Just as physical fitness can be measured by how well you perform in a race or a workout, your emotional fitness can be evaluated with assessments like the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) or the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).


Emotional wellness is an important aspect of health; however, it's not the only one. While improving your emotional wellness will likely improve your overall health and happiness, there are other ways to increase these things as well — for example: by exercising regularly or eating healthy foods.


Intellectual wellness
Intellectual wellness is about learning and applying knowledge. It’s also about challenging yourself to take on new challenges and learn more.
